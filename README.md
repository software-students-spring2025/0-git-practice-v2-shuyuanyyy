I found this article interesting and insightful:  
[How AI Will Change Software Engineering](https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/how-ai-will-change-software-engineering)  

## Why I Find It Interesting 

This article explores how **AI is transforming the role of software engineers** and which skills will be critical in the future. I find this particularly interesting because it emphasizes that AI **wonâ€™t replace** software engineers but will **reshape** how we work. Engineers who can adapt, think critically, and collaborate with AI tools will be in high demand. While AI may handle repetitive coding tasks, ensuring the **usability, maintainability, and efficiency of software** remains a responsibility of humans. This shift enables a stronger focus on refining the final product and making it more user-friendly, and adaptable.
